# JLine with Groovy

A lightweight example for experimenting with
terminal input/output using the JLine library with Groovy.

The app:

* Demonstrates a minimal integration of JLine 3 with a Groovy application.
* Creates a Terminal and LineReader, prints a greeting
* Prompts the user with "JLine > ", reads one line of input, prints it, then
  closes the terminal.
